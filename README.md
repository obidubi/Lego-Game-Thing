# Lego-Game-Thing
This is a small video game project written in Java using LWJGL. The ultimate goal is to create a small game where players can build stuff out of legos and fly them around. It isn't a very serious project, so the code hasn't been optimized or "beautified". For now, it's just a project for testing out different ideas for how to make a game like this work.
